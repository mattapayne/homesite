  My passion is writing software and I look for opportunities for interesting side projects 
  in addition to day to day work. Software components that are written several times can be made somewhat generic 
  and broken out into reusable modules. In these cases, I like to create a project
  and make it available to the open source software development community.

  Listed below are some of my more recent projects.
</p>
<h3><%= link_to("Jambase4Rails", "http://github.com/mattapayne/jambase4rails", :target => "_blank") %></h3>

  the <%= link_to("Jambase", "http://www.jambase.com", :target => "_blank") %> (an online live concert archive) API.

<h3><%= link_to("Tumblr4Rails", "http://github.com/mattapayne/tumblr4rails", :target => "_blank") %></h3>

<h3><%= link_to("SlimTimerOnShoes", "http://github.com/mattapayne/slimtimeronshoes", :target => "_blank")%></h3>
<p>
  A small open source application, written using <%= link_to("Shoes", "http://shoooes.net", :target => "_blank") %>, that
  allows users to interact with <%= link_to("SlimTimer", "http://slimtimer.com", :taget => "_blank") %>. 
  SlimTimer is a web application that allows the user to track time against tasks. It's a very
  useful tool for freelance developers.
