<p>
  My passion is writing software and I look for opportunities for interesting side projects 
  in addition to day to day work. Software components that are written several times can be made somewhat generic 
  and broken out into reusable modules. In these cases, I like to create a project
  and make it available to the open source software development community.

  Listed below are some of my more recent projects.

<h3><%= link_to("IT Freelancer", "http://itfreelancer.ca", :target => "_blank") %></h3>
<p>
	IT Freelancer is a site designed to connect independent Canadian IT professionals with potential clients. It is a completely free service and will be release publicly soon. At the moment, it is beta testing. The site is built using Ruby on Rails and is waiting to be given a nice look &amp; feel by a designer.

<h3><%= link_to("Complainatron", "http://complainatron.ca", :target => "_blank") %></h3>
<p>
  Complainatron (a work in progress) will be a simple, free, location-aware and anonymous API for for mobile users to randomly complain and to vote on the complaints of others. It a fun project that I and several friends came up with.
