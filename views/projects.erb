    My passion is writing software and I look for opportunities for interesting side projects 
    in addition to day to day work. Software components that are written several times can be made somewhat generic 
    and broken out into reusable modules. In these cases, I like to create a project
    and make it available to the open source software development community.

    Listed below are some of my more recent projects.

  <h3><%= link_to("Jambase4Rails", "http://github.com/mattapayne/jambase4rails", :target => "_blank") %></h3>
  <p>
    An open source Ruby on Rails plugin that lets developers easily hook into
    the <%= link_to("Jambase", "http://www.jambase.com", :target => "_blank") %> (an online live concert archive) API.
  </p>
  <h3><%= link_to("Tumblr4Rails", "http://github.com/mattapayne/tumblr4rails", :target => "_blank") %></h3>
  <p>
    An open source Ruby on Rails plugin that lets developers read and write to
    Tumblelogs using the <%= link_to("Tumblr", "http://tumblr.com", :target => "_blank") %> API.
